# Sentiment Analysis of Song Lyrics

![Sentiment Analysis of Song Lyrics](insert_image_link_here)

## Overview
This project focuses on sentiment analysis of song lyrics using the VADER sentiment intensity analyzer. It includes data loading, sentiment analysis of lyrics, model evaluation, and sentiment prediction for new lyrics.

## Project Description
In this project, we analyze song lyrics to classify them as positive, negative, or neutral based on their sentiment scores. The project includes the following components:

### Data Loading and Merging
We load song lyric datasets from various artists (e.g., Nicki Minaj, Rihanna, Post Malone) and merge them into a single dataset for analysis.

### Sentiment Analysis
We use the VADER sentiment intensity analyzer from NLTK to assign sentiment labels (positive, negative, or neutral) to each song lyric. The sentiment analysis is based on the compound sentiment score.

### Model Evaluation
We split the data into training and testing sets and evaluate the performance of the sentiment analysis model. Metrics such as accuracy and a classification report are provided.

### Sentiment Prediction for New Lyrics
We demonstrate how to use the trained model to predict the sentiment of new song lyrics.

## Dataset
The datasets used in this project are sourced from various artists and can be found in separate CSV files. Each CSV file contains lyrics from a specific artist.

## Dependencies
To run this project, you will need the following dependencies:

- Python (>=3.6)
- pandas
- nltk
- scikit-learn

$# Setup
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
2. Download the song lyric datasets (provided in separate CSV files) and place them in the project directory.
3. Install the required dependencies as mentioned above.

## Usage
1. Ensure that you have followed the setup steps.
2. Run the provided Jupyter Notebook or Python script to perform sentiment analysis on the song lyrics dataset.
3. You can customize the sentiment analysis model or use it to predict sentiment for new lyrics.

## Results
The project provides insights into sentiment analysis of song lyrics and includes the accuracy of the sentiment analysis model and a detailed classification report. Additionally, it demonstrates how to predict sentiment for new song lyrics.
